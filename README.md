# DOCMaster
A python script / EXE for helping teachers format word documents submitted by their students.

# What it does
DOCMaster is a user-friendly program that helps you process multiple Microsoft Word documents (.docx) at once. 

You can personalize each document by adding details such as the class code, subject, teacher's name, term, unit number, unit title, and assignment name. You can also choose to double space your documents, standardize the font, include the filename in the header, add page numbers, and create a merged PDF file for easy printing.

Once you have selected the documents you want to process, just click a button and the program will do the rest. It will copy the header content from a template to each document, and modify formatting as per your chosen options.


# Who it's for
This program is useful for teachers, students, or anyone who needs to process a large number of .docx files. It can help you save time and create a standardized look for your documents.
